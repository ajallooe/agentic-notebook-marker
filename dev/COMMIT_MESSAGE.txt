Add create_overview.py utility for automatic overview.md generation

Created a standalone utility that generates overview.md files from Jupyter
notebooks using LLM analysis. This tool runs separately from and before the
marking workflow.

## New Utility: create_overview.py

**Purpose:**
Automatically analyze a Jupyter notebook and generate a properly formatted
overview.md configuration file using LLM analysis.

**Features:**
- Analyzes notebook structure (cell counts, activity markers, content)
- Detects assignment type automatically (structured vs free-form)
- Generates comprehensive overview.md with:
  - YAML frontmatter (provider, model, assignment type, total marks)
  - Assignment overview and description
  - Learning objectives (3-5 key points)
  - Assignment structure with detected activities
  - Grading criteria breakdown
  - Additional notes
- Places output file in same directory as the notebook
- Prevents overwriting existing overview.md files

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 src/create_overview.py <notebook_path> --model <model_name>

# Or using the wrapper script:
./create_overview.sh <notebook_path> --model <model_name>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
python3 src/create_overview.py assignments/lab1/notebook.ipynb --model claude-sonnet-4-5
./create_overview.sh notebook.ipynb --model gemini-2.5-pro
./create_overview.sh notebook.ipynb --model gpt-5.1
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Extracts notebook statistics (total cells, code cells, markdown cells)
- Samples first few markdown cells for context
- Detects activity markers (**[A1]**, **[A2]**, etc.) for structured assignments
- Uses llm_caller.sh for provider-agnostic LLM calls
- Automatically determines provider from model name prefix
- Validates input (checks file exists, is .ipynb extension)
- Clear error messages for common issues

**Error Handling:**
- Exits with error if overview.md already exists (prevents accidental overwriting)
- Validates notebook path exists
- Validates file extension is .ipynb
- Provides helpful error messages

## Shell Wrapper: create_overview.sh

Created a simple bash wrapper script that:
- Passes all arguments directly to create_overview.py
- Uses absolute path resolution for reliability
- Includes usage documentation in header comments
- Executable and ready to use

## Documentation Updates

**README.md:**
- Added new section "Generating overview.md Automatically"
- Includes usage examples for all three providers
- Explains what the utility does
- Notes about file protection and prerequisites
- Positioned before "For Structured Assignments" section

## Testing Results

✓ **Help message** displays correctly with usage examples
✓ **Error handling** prevents overwriting existing overview.md files
✓ **Notebook analysis** successfully extracts:
  - Cell counts (total, code, markdown)
  - Activity markers for structured assignments
  - First few markdown cells for context
✓ **LLM integration** tested with all three providers:
  - Claude: Works correctly, creates files in subdirectories
  - Gemini: Works correctly, creates files in subdirectories
  - Codex: Works correctly (file-moving workaround already in place)
✓ **Output generation** creates properly formatted overview.md
✓ **File placement** correctly places output in notebook's directory
✓ **Shell wrapper** works correctly, passes arguments through

## Provider File Creation Capabilities

Testing confirmed all three providers can create files correctly:

**Claude Code:**
- Creates files in subdirectories without issues
- Uses Write tool natively
- No file-moving workaround needed

**Gemini CLI:**
- Creates files in subdirectories without issues
- Uses shell commands for file operations
- Restricted to workspace directory (cannot write to /tmp)
- No file-moving workaround needed

**Codex CLI:**
- May create files in project root's processed/ directory
- File-moving workaround already implemented in pattern_designer.py
- Workaround automatically relocates files to correct subdirectories

## Files Changed

- **src/create_overview.py** (NEW) - Standalone overview generator utility
- **create_overview.sh** (NEW) - Shell wrapper script
- **README.md** - Added documentation section with usage examples
- **dev/COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt** - Updated (this file is rewritten for each commit)

## Usage Workflow

1. Create or obtain a Jupyter notebook assignment
2. Run create_overview.py to generate overview.md:
   ```bash
   ./create_overview.sh assignments/lab1/notebook.ipynb --model claude-sonnet-4-5
   ```
3. Review and adjust the generated overview.md as needed
4. Run the marking workflow:
   ```bash
   ./mark_structured.sh assignments/lab1
   ```

This utility streamlines the setup process by automatically generating the
overview.md configuration file, which previously had to be created manually.
